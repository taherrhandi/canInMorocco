      The CPES 2024 National Organizing Committee reserves the right to cancel
      CPES 2024 without notice or compensation in the event of any delay, default,
      failure or cancelation of implementation of any deliverable to or for
      the CPES 2024 which has been caused, directly or indirectly, by any incident of
      “force majeure”. For the purposes hereof, the term “force majeure” shall mean any incident,
      circumstance or cause which renders delivery of the CPES 2024 substantially or totally
      impossible or impracticable and which is beyond the control of the CPES 2024 National Organizing Committee.
      The term shall include but not be limited to the following:

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any strike, or other industrial action of any kind;</li>
      <li>Fire, flood, or adverse weather conditions;</li>
      <li>Unavoidable breakdown or destruction of facilities or equipment;</li>
      <li>Failure of carriers, delays in performance or delivery by sub-contractors or any other breach by a third
        party of a material obligation towards the CPES 2024 National Organizing Committee;</li>
      <li>Power failure;</li>
      <li>Promulgation/amendment/rescission of any relevant legislation or regulation by local or national government;
      </li>
      <li> Any occurrence of any nature which renders it reasonably necessary for the CPES 2024 National Organizing
        Committee to cancel the CPES 2024.

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In such circumstances, the CPES 2024 National Organizing Committee and the CPES 2024 organizers are hereby
      indemnified and shall not be liable to any delegate, supplier or other service provider for any loss or damage
      save that the CPES 2024 National Organizing Committee shall only be liable to reimburse the relevant party such
      amounts as may actually have been received by the CPES 2024 National Organizing Committee BUT AFTER deduction of
      any costs that have been reasonably incurred by it up to the point of cancelation in preparing the Congress. This
      limited liability does not extend to any payments that may have been made directly or indirectly (on behalf of
      delegates/attendees/service providers, etc.) to third parties such as hotels or airlines.</p>
    <p>The IFAC 2023 National Organizing Committee and the CPES 2024 organizers shall not be responsible for any theft,
      breakage, destruction or damages of any kind whatsoever and howsoever caused to personal and/or business items of
      delegates, accompanying persons, children, or other attendees.</p>
    <p>All delegates are to make themselves fully aware of the health and visa requirements in respect of travel to
      Japan; in the event that an individual is unable to participate in the Congress due to not meeting these
      requirements in any way, neither the CPES 2024 National Organizing Committee nor the CPES 2024 organizers accept
